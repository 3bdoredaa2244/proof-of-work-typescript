  "description": "#### Objective: In this assignment, you will develop a simple blockchain using TypeScript. Your task is to create a `Block` and `Blockchain` class that simulate the process of mining, validating, and adding blocks to a chain. The `Block` will go through multiple states (e.g., Created, Mining, Mined, Confirmed, Rejected) based on predefined validation rules. Additionally, you will implement continuous block mining with random data generation.",
